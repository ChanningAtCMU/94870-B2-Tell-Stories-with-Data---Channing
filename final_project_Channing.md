# Final Project Part 1

## Outline
The primary audience for this story will be people who want to be or want their kids to become Formula One drivers. If possible, I’d also like to promote this sport to others who currently have no conception of what it is, but that’s not the main point of this story. <br/>
The title will be “How to Become a Formula One Driver in One Minute.” In this short minute, I will use a plain tone to describe all the terms from this sport built on excitement.<br>
The story will have 5 different parts. The first part will introduce the history of F1 with a comparison of everyday things that the audience could get contact with in their daily life. What is F1? What are the differences between this racing and go-karts? <br>
In the second part, the discussion will be about realistic questions like “What will be the rough timeline for someone to become an F1 driver?” and “How much does it cost?” will be answered.<br>
In the third part, I will discuss how to prepare an ordinary person. What are the potential risks for this sport? What can they do now to get physically prepared?<br>
In the fourth part, as the audience might get tired reading through all things above, I will talk about some fun facts regarding F1.<br>
For the last part, I will introduce the participating constructors to help people to select their future teams.<br>
