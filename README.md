## About me
Hello all! My name is Changzhou Zheng, and you can call me Channing. I am currently an MISM student who has one more semester to go before graduation. Fun fact about me: I love recording my life. With an action camera and a drone, I have recorded more than 500GB of videos regarding my life, vacation, etc. Clipping vlogs is also my interest, but laziness is my biggest enemy :)

## What I hope to learn
My future career plan is to become a tech consultant. I love to discuss with people regarding tech-related topics. And I know it is essential to convince people with insightful images, charts, or any other visualization categories. So I will try my best to learn and understand the aesthetic approaches to optimize graphs and get down to some of the popular visualization tools to facilitate me to produce neat and convincing visualizations.

With the knowledge from this course, I hope to elevate my capability to present or describe data and facts to a higher level.

Here is one of my data visualization projects I've done when I was a undergradute student at Syracuse University. ðŸ‘‡
