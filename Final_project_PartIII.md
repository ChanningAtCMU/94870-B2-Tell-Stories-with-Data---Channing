# Final Project, Part III

## Changes being made
It was a hard decision to choose among all the options I have thought about, heard, and seen. Although I firmly believed that the topic would be Formula One, hundreds of debates were going on in my head about which aspect I should focus on before making this final decision. My initial thought was to talk about how an F1 driver could better prepare for the games. Later, I realized this would be too intricate for my audience because of the massive and long medical vocabulary I would refer to. Thus, I changed my direction a little bit and started to think about the possibility of introducing the structure of the F1 race crafts. But again, the large number of jargon even made myself confused. After hearing the suggestions from Professor Goranson and Chanaradee, I noticed that it would be easier for me and others if I could have a commonly tangible topic, such as <em>introducing F1 to parents who found their kids talented in driving</em>.
Ultimately, I have shifted the focus a little bit to the current topic. I would like everyone – not just the kids but also the parents – to have an opportunity to join this sport.
