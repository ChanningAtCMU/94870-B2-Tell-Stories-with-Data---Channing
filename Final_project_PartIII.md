# Final Project, Part III
Project Portal: [What You Should Know as A F1 Talent Scout](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/telling-story-with-data-f1-scout/index.html)

## Changes being made
It was a hard decision to choose among all the options I have thought about, heard, and seen. Although I firmly believed that the topic would be Formula One, hundreds of debates were going on in my head about which aspect I should focus on before making this final decision. My initial thought was to talk about how an F1 driver could better prepare for the games. Later, I realized this would be too intricate for my audience because of the massive and long medical vocabulary I would refer to. Thus, I changed my direction a little bit and started to think about the possibility of introducing the structure of the F1 race crafts. But again, the large number of jargon even made myself confused. After hearing the suggestions from Professor Goranson and Chanaradee, I noticed that it would be easier for me and others if I could have a commonly tangible topic, such as <em>introducing F1 to parents who found their kids talented in driving</em>.
Ultimately, I have shifted the focus a little bit to the current topic. I would like everyone – not just the kids but also the parents – to have an opportunity to join this sport.

## Call To Action
This project provides tips for incoming F1 scouts regarding choosing their preferred team and finding talented young drivers. For example, for finding good teams, we have an investment in junior teams as a critical index; and for discovering potentially competitive drivers, we have parameters such as nationalities, evaluation indices, etc. After going through the content, one may have a preference for how they will discover a good driver and their favorite teams in their mind.

## Data
Fortunately, I have found a generous contributor (ID: toUpperCase78) in the GitHub community who is willing to share the data he collected and the analyses he has done. I have also scraped the publicly available F1 historical championships data from Wikipedia.
