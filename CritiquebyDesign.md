### Step one: find a data visualization
[MoterSport Stats - Formula One Stats](https://www.motorsportstats.com/results/formula-one/2022/brazilian-grand-prix/standings)
Click on **Constructor** on the left and choose **POS** for **View**.


### Step two: critique the data visualization

### Step three: sketch out a solution

### Step four: Test the solution
Q1: In 10 seconds, can you tell me what this chart is about?
Q2: Which part of the chart is the most eye-catching?
Q3: What are the things that you are confused? 
Q4: I will explain to you what this chart is about. After that, tell me your new concentration on this chart.
Q5: If you are a fan of F1, what else do you wish to see? What on this chart you want to see less.

Interviewee  | Feedback
------------- | -------------
Student, mid 20'  | A1: Maybe a geographic report because I saw national flags on the top.
A2: The way the chart was made was clean and concise.
A3: I noticed the numbers in the chart but had no idea what those were about. No title telling me what type of data it is.
A4: (After listening to my explanation) Now much better. I started to find the constructor who won the most championships. But I still don't understand the meaning of FL and PP, which were all over the chart.
A5: I'd like to see my favorite constructor's logo in the chart. That makes me more excited.
Student, late 20'  | A1: Some kind of games or matches between national teams.
A2: All the top three numbers for each country were highlighted, which was good because that tells me directly who won the game.
A3: What do "PTS" and "GAP" mean? And why the last country has no data at all?
A4: Okay, now I learned that Red Bull is the best team while Williams got a lot of improvement space. I'm focusing on finding out the trend for mid-table teams. And I'd also like to know the ranking gap between the two drivers for each constructor.
A5: I don't think having the constructor logos on the left of their names was a good idea. You should eliminate the duplicated information. You might need to get rid of the blank column at the end as well.


### Step five: Build your solution
